About This Blog Series

Welcome to my personal blog documenting my journey through systems programming, automation, and digital productivity as part of my course in Business and Computing.

This blog showcases four core topics—each one focused on helping me grow as a developer by improving how I understand and use my computing environment.



1. Optimizing My Linux Shell with ZSH and Dotfiles

I dive into customizing my terminal using ZSH and dotfiles to streamline development. From themes and aliases to Git-tracked config files, this post shows how small tweaks in your shell environment can lead to major productivity gains.


2. Automating My Workflow with Bash and Cron

I identify a repetitive task and automate it using Bash scripting and cron jobs. This post shares the full process—problem, script, automation setup, and impact—highlighting the value of personal automation.



3. Monitoring and Managing My System Like a Pro

I explore powerful Linux tools like htop, ps, and df to learn how to monitor and manage system performance. As developers, understanding system behavior helps in debugging, resource management, and building efficient software.



4. Building My First Automation Tool in C

My first full automation project in C—a simple command-line task tracker—helped me grasp memory management, file operations, and program design. This post documents the learning process, from concept to working CLI tool.
