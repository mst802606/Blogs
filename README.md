FocusBuddy Blog Series – Build Better Focus with Bash

This blog series documents the journey behind FocusBuddy, a lightweight, ADHD-friendly terminal automation tool built in Bash to support structured focus and break sessions.

Over four posts, I explore the personal motivation, technical implementation, iterative improvements, and life lessons that shaped this tool—from a simple script into a daily support system.



1. Why I Built FocusBuddy

“Designing for ADHD, not despite it.”
I share my personal experiences with ADHD and explain how the mental burden of planning, task switching, and executive dysfunction led me to create a terminal-based tool that removes friction and builds structure. This post dives into user-first design thinking rooted in real-world struggles.


2. How It Works

“A simple Bash script with a powerful flow.”
Here, I break down the architecture of FocusBuddy: task prompts, Pomodoro timers, auto-logging to CSV, and break reminders. You’ll see how standard shell tools (sleep, date, read, etc.) come together to automate a full productivity cycle.


3. Improving FocusBuddy

“Making small changes that make a big difference.”
Once the base script worked, I began improving it with session customization, mood tracking, break suggestions, and even a GUI prototype using zenity. This post highlights how every feature came from a lived need and made the tool more ADHD-friendly and supportive.


4. What I Learned

“FocusBuddy taught me more than code.”
The final post reflects on deeper insights: how automation reduces decision fatigue, why self-compassion is a design feature, and what it means to build tools that truly work with your brain. A closing chapter on personal growth through purposeful scripting.
